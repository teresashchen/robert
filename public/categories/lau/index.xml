      <description>English version Mr. Lau&amp;rsquo;s teaching philosophy is grounded as HK style. Mr. Lau has more than 40 years of teaching experience, where he has established a comprehensive running system of violin and violas. This includes bowing, fingering, scales, etudes and concerto&amp;rsquo;s. The collaborative interactions between Mr. Lau and his students pave a progressive learning path that builds up strong foundation and success.
Majority of Mr. Lau&amp;rsquo;s students become top violinists. As a matter of fact, some students were selected as concert masters.</description>
